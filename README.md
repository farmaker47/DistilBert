Android Question Answering application using KerasNLP model with 512 token inputs from the [documentation](https://keras.io/api/keras_nlp/models/bert/bert_backbone/). You can download the model from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1owZTr38kyf0NLKbviFdyYaf11OU_OWGc/view?usp=sharing) and paste it into the assets folder of the project to work. This project is a revamp of the project [here](https://github.com/huggingface/tflite-android-transformers/tree/master/bert).

For this specific branch there is an option to use the [Gemini Pro API](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/android_quickstart#kotlin_3), just create an API key and place it inside QaActivity (if you are in Europe you will need also a VPN).
